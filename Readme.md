## Introduction
The Yelp challenge dataset was chosen because we want to work on a scope with potentially real business needs. After doing a simple explanatory analysis of the dataset and integrating the feedback from the project proposal, our team decided to initiate a project on offering data analysis targeting business owners and potential investors by concentrating on the following products: a dashboard for an overview of the market,  an analysis of usersâ€™ reviews using natural language processing to provide insight, and a machine learning algorithm offering recommendation about where to choose the location for the chain restaurants. A specific region, Alberta province was chosen for project demonstration.
